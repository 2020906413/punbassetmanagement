# punbassetmanagement

This final year project is aimed at developing a comprehensive asset tagging system
for PUNB (Perbanan Usahawan Nasional Berhad), a government organization
established by the government of Malaysia to assist and develop national
entrepreneurs. The main function of PUNB is as a government agency to provide
assistance and guidance to national entrepreneurs in building and developing their
businesses. The asset tagging system is specifically designed to manage the inventory
of IT assets, which play a crucial role in the operations of PUNB. The system uses
barcode technology to ensure accurate and efficient recording of IT asset data, which
is essential for effective asset management. One of the main objectives of this project
is to simplify the process of recording data related to IT assets, thus reducing the time
and effort required for manual data entry and allowing for real-time updates. The use
of barcode technology will eliminate the risk of human error and provide a more
reliable method for tracking IT assets. The asset tagging system will also provide
improved visibility into PUNB&#39;s IT assets, allowing for better decision-making and
improved asset utilization. This project will also evaluate the feasibility of using asset
tagging for PUNB&#39;s IT assets and determine the best practices for implementing the
system in a manner that is effective and efficient. The results of this project will
contribute to the development of a more efficient and effective asset management
system for PUNB and provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of using
asset tagging for other organizations. In conclusion, the asset tagging system will
provide PUNB with a powerful tool for managing its IT assets, improving data
accuracy and reducing manual efforts. This project will pave the way for the
development of a more effective and efficient asset management system that will help
PUNB to optimize its operations and maximize the value of its IT assets.
